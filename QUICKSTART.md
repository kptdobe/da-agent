```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment file
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your API key

nano .env  # or use your preferred editor

# Start the server
npm run dev
```

```

## Step 2: Install Chrome Extension

2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top right corner)

3. Click **"Load unpacked"** button

4. Navigate to and select the `chrome-extension` folder from this project

5. The DA Agent extension should now appear in your extensions list

## Step 3: Test It Out

1. Navigate to `https://da.live` (or `http://localhost:3000` if running locally)

2. Click the DA Agent extension icon in your browser toolbar

3. The side panel will open with the chat interface

4. Try a simple command:
   ```
   List the documents in this folder
   ```

## Example Usage

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start

### Extension not appearing
- Refresh the extensions page

### Side panel doesn't open
- Make sure you're on a DA site (`da.live` or `localhost:3000`)
- Try clicking the extension icon again
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

### No response from AI
- Check backend is running (`http://localhost:3101/health`)
- Verify API key is valid
- Check backend console for errors
